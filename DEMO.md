# HealthDash - Interactive Health Analytics Dashboard

HealthDash is an interactive frontend health analytics dashboard that visualizes daily & weekly vitals (heart rate, steps, sleep, calories) with live charts, an interactive water tracker, and a symptom checker. Built purely in the frontend using React, Tailwind, Recharts and Framer Motion.
